sPotholes is a software for reporting potholes in and around the city. Built in collaboration with [Redemptive Cycles](http://www.redemptivecycles.com), sPotholes features crowdsourced pothole "popularity", user leaderboards and integration with the municipal pipeline. You report the potholes, and the city gets a better idea of what needs to be addressed most urgently.

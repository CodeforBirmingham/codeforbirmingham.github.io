The City of Birmingham made available to us a dataset of all traffic accidents in the Birmingham city limits that happened between 2012 and 2014. This project is about analyzing and interpreting this dataset, as well as creating reporting tools for the City of Birmingham—with the goal of preventing future accidents.
